# Fire Chat

## Introduction

Hello! We are group s201 and this is our submission for problem statement #3 of the TikTok Hackathon 2023. We chose this problem as we felt that the TikTok shop experience was too one sided; The potential buyer would ask the seller a question about the product, and the seller would then answer these questions. However, there was no way for the potential buyer to know if these answers are accurate or not, except to rely on the reviews of the product, which can be difficult to verify as well.

## Solution

To tackle this problem, we decided that a live chat feature should be added to the shop, whereby products would have chat room to allow users to not just ask questions about the product, but also discuss about the product. This would provide the customers with a clearer environment to shop, allowing the potential customer to be more confident in their choices and as such increasing the value that we can provide through the app. We came up with this solution as we realised that customers today are more reliant on community feedback, through platforms such as Reddit where many product discussions can be found. Thus, we thought, why not integrate this feature directly into the shop itself.


## Installation instructions

1. Run `npm install` from within this folder.
2. Once the installation is done, run `npm start`. This would spin up a local server allows you to view the project.
